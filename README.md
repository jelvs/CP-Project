# Concurrency and Paralelism Project


 In this project we are asked to implement a set of Patterns for Parallel Programming using Cilk+.
 
 We are supposed to implement at least the following patterns: 
 
  **Map**
  **Reduce**
  **Scan** 
  **Pack** 
  **Gather** 
  **Scatter**
  **Pipeline** 
  **Farm** 
    
  ...and optimize your code to be as fast and as scalable as possible.
